    "## Introduction to the HPE OneView API\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is a style of API that uses basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations that are performed on resources using HTTP POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests. To learn more about general REST concepts, see\n",
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer  \n",
    "HPE OneView has a resource-oriented architecture that provides a uniform REST interface. Every resource has one Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and represents a physical device or logical construct, and may be manipulated using REST APIs. To view the list of resources, see the [HPE OneView API Reference](https://techlibrary.hpe.com/docs/enterprise/servers/oneview5.0/cicf-api/en/index.html#about)  \n",
