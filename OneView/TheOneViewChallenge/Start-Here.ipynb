    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend the following Discover Hack Shack workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Git 101](WKSHP-GIT101/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)  `# Only if you don't master Git basics`\n",

    "\n",
    "## Fork the Challenge Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage GitHub to provide the response templates and collect your response. This means that your reponse will be delivered via a Git Pull Request in this [OneViewChallenge](https://github.com/HPEDevCom/OneViewChallenge) repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "But before, **you need to fork** this [OneView Challenge](https://github.com/HPEDevCom/OneViewChallenge.git) repository into your own GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GitFork](Pictures/GitFork.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone the repo in your Jupyter environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account, **you have to clone** it into this Jupyter environment here are some steps to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the OneView Challenge GitHub repo location in **your clipboard**. **Be sure to clone your forked copy, not the original repo or you will not be able to submit your work**\n",
    "\n",
    "![ClipboardGitLocation](Pictures/ClipboardOfGit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From your Jupyter environment, **Select `Terminal`** at the bottom left of the main `Launcher` pane, . If you don't have any Launcher pane, click on the `+` sign in the upper left of the left pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LauncherPane](Pictures/StartTerminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform the **clone**\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue the following commands in your terminal, using Ctrl-V to paste the content of your clipboard: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "cd Discover/TheOneViewChallenge\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/<YourGitHubLocation>/OneViewChallenge.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![GitClone](Pictures/GitClone.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work on your challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the content of the OneView Challenge repo is downloaded in your Jupyter account, from the left pane, navigate to the `OneviewChallenge` directory and open the notebook you will find there\n",
    "\n",
    "It's now time for you to do the real work :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Racing against the clock\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you are working against the clock here. You have 4 hours after we provided you access to the Jupyter account. If your time is running out, make sure you commit and push your changes to your copy of the repo in order to avoid losing any work."
